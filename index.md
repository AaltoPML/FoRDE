# Particle-based variational inference for neural network ensembles

Ensemble methods, which combine predictions from multiple models, are a well-known strategy in machine learning to boost predictive performance, uncertainty estimation and robustness under covariate shifts.
The successes of ensemble methods are mainly due to the **functional diversity of their members**.
For neural networks, one can create an ensemble by training multiple neural networks from different independent random initializations, a strategy called Deep ensembles (DEs).
The effectiveness of a DE depends on the randomness of the training procedure to implicitly induce weight-space diversity, as independent training runs under different random conditions will likely converge to different modes in the weight posterior distribution.
However, weight diversities do not necessarily translate into useful functional diversities due to the inherent symmetries in the weight space, i.e., two sets of weights can represent the same function.

To explicitly promote diversity in a neural network ensemble, **particle-based variational inference (ParVI)** has recently emerged as a promising approach.
Notably, the ParVI update rule includes a kernelized repulsion term $k(f, f^\prime)$ between ensemble members $f, f^\prime$ to control the diversity.
Current approaches compare networks in weight space or function space.
Weight-space repulsion is ineffective due to the extremely high dimensionality and symmetries of the weight posterior.
Comparing neural networks via a function kernel is also challenging since functions are infinite-dimensional objects. Previous works resort to comparing functions only on a subset of the input space. Comparing functions
over training data leads to underfitting, likely because these inputs have known labels, leaving no room for diverse predictions without impairing performance.
Neither weight nor function space repulsion has led to significant improvements over vanilla DEs.
